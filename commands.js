"\nWelcome to a mini project/portfolio all about me & my hobbies :)\n" +
"\nI'm a rising senior (4th year) at Georgia Tech juggling Computer Science and Psychology with a big love for learning. When I'm not hitting the books, you'll find me spending time with loved ones, reading my beloved fantasy or lyrical prose novels, getting my hands messy with arts and crafts, capturing cool moments with my film camera, or watching YouTube videos on anything from interior decor and fashion, to social experiments, keyboards, and marine organisms. I love painting and staying active, and I'm always up for new adventures and experiences. Whether it's figuring out the human mind or coding, I'm all about mixing creativity with curiosity in everything I do.\n" +
"\nThis website is a fun project I put togeter in my free time to learn a bit about JavaScript. It's been such a joy to dive into coding, experiment, and create something from scratch, I'm really excited to share it with you, and I hope you have as much fun exploring it as I did creating it & thank you for stopping by :)\n";
